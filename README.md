newton_best.py performs Newton's method on a given function for a grid of points, coloring them based on which root of the function the point converges to. This script also has functionality
for Newton nova fractals, adding some value c at each step of Newton's method. This script can also process images in batches with varied c values, which when put into a GIF, create some pretty
interesting patterns. Currently, this program is only compatible with functions that have up to 15 roots (the colorMap variable can be extended to resolve this if desired).
I also attached some of the more interesting images and GIFs generated with this script :)
